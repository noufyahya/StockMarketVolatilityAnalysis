the goal of this project is to analyze and model stock market volatility to understand how much a stock fluctuates over time.

why do we need Volatility ?
  Volatility measures how much the price of a stock fluctuates over time. It is typically calculated as the standard deviation of daily returns and is expressed as a percentage. 
  High volatility means the stock price can change dramatically in a short period, while low volatility means the price is relatively stable.
